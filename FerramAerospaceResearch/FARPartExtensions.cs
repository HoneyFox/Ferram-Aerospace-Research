    Serious thanks:		a.g., for tons of bugfixes and code-refactorings
            			Taverius, for correcting a ton of incorrect values
            			sarbian, for refactoring code for working with MechJeb, and the Module Manager 1.5 updates
            			ialdabaoth (who is awesome), who originally created Module Manager
                        Regex, for adding RPM support
            			Duxwing, for copy editing the readme
